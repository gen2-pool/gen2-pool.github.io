			<h2 class="">2. Definitions</h2>
			<div class="">
				<div class="">
					<div class="">2.1</div>
					<div>“Blockchain” means a distributed digital ledger that is
						not under the control of a single identifiable or discreet
						individual or entity and where accounts (including units of
						account contained in them) cannot be manipulated without providing
						a user’s specific private key. This may be a “main net” used as a
						determinative record of historical events and transactions on the
						ledger, or a “test net” which operates like a main net but does
						not have a Cryptocurrency that carries substantial real-world
						value and is generally used for simulated or testing purposes.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">2.2</div>
					<div>“Cryptocurrency”, “Cryptocurrencies” is a reference to
						the distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer digital currencies
						that are tracked by a Blockchain. For the purposes of this Terms
						of Use, “Cryptocurrency” includes, but is not limited to, the
						following distributed digital ledgers (both related main nets and
						test nets): Tezos, Cosmos, Kava, Kusama, Terra, Irisnet, CyberWay,
						Chainlink, Algorand, Threshold, Solana, Polkadot, Robonomics, Ton,
						Celo, Regen, Oasis, Coda, Dfinity.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">2.3</div>
					<div>“User Data” means all data, files and information that
						User provides to GenZ Staking in the course of using the Services.
						Although we perform regular routine backups of data, you are
						solely responsible for all data that you transmit or that relates
						to any activity you have undertaken using the Site. You agree that
						we shall have no liability to you for any loss or corruption of
						any such data, and you hereby waive any right of action against us
						arising from any such loss or corruption of such data. Note that
						any information posted to a public blockchain is accessible to the
						public, and you should not expect confidentiality nor a guarantee
						against reproduction for such (whether or not in connection to our
						Services). Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information
						about how we collect, use, and share your information.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">2.4</div>
					<div>“User Funds” means the Cryptocurrencies controlled by
						User or delegated to GenZ Staking’s control but ultimately
						belonging to User.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">2.5</div>
					<div>“Validator Rewards” means all Cryptocurrency generated
						by operating Validator Nodes, including, but not limited to, block
						rewards, endorser rewards, transaction fees and any other direct
						payments as a result of operating a Validator Node.</div>

			<h2 class="">3. Our Responsibilities</h2>
			<div class="">
				<div class="">
					<div class="">3.1</div>
					<div>Validation – GenZ Staking operates Staking Validator
						Nodes to support the decentralized functioning of various
						Blockchains. GenZ Staking maintains all of the hardware, software,
						connectivity, technological, management &amp; supervision, and any
						other requirements to properly deploy these Validator Nodes. You
						may use your Cryptocurrencies (as allowed by the related
						Blockchains) to support our status as a Delegated Staking
						Validator for those Blockchains. We will distribute Validator
						Rewards generated by our Staking Validators among those who
						designated Cryptocurrencies to support our status as a Validator
						proportionate to the amount of Cryptocurrencies they use to
						designate such support as is consistent with our advertisements or
						website and the customs of each supported Blockchain.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">3.2</div>
					<div>Support – We aim to provide quality and timely support
						for each of our Services. You can email us at am@genzstaking.com
						with any questions or technical issues and we will assist you as
						soon as we can.</div>
				</div>
			</div>

		<article class="">
			<h2 class="">4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
			<div class="">
				<div class="">
					<div class="">4.1</div>
					<div>In the use of any of our Services, you agree to take the
						following actions, or to otherwise agree to carry any liability,
						responsibility, and accountability as described below.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">4.2</div>
					<div>Delegation Decisions – You have sole discretion as to
						whether to and how much Cryptocurrencies will be designated
						towards support of our status as a Delegated Validator. As is the
						nature of Blockchain systems, you are in full control of
						designating Cryptocurrencies, and must tend to the operations and
						current events required for responsible designation.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">4.3</div>
					<div>Taxes and Other Legal Obligations – You are responsible
						for paying any taxes related to your Cryptocurrencies, whether it
						involves appreciation in value, capital gains, general income
						(including those from Staking Rewards), or any other types of
						taxable income. You also agree not to use our Services in any
						illegal manner or to support any illegal activity, and to comply
						with any other applicable laws or regulations on your use of
						Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">4.4</div>
					<div>Malicious Behavior – You will not take any steps to harm
						our systems or our ability to provide our Services to you or
						others, other than those permitted by these Terms, our systems, or
						our written or verbal instructions. Any attempt at unauthorized
						use of our private keys, inhibiting the functionality of our
						technical equipment and hardware (e.g. malware or DDoS), or other
						method to direct our systems to function in a way that is not
						permitted (as determined in our sole discretion) is considered a
						violation of these terms.</div>
				</div>
				<div class="">
					<div class="">4.5</div>
					<div>Typical Risk of Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies – Your
						use of any Blockchain is subject to the risk and limitations of
						that Blockchain, including, but not limited to, fifty-one attacks,
						mis-addressed transactions, Sybil attacks, eclipse attacks,
						compromised private keys, or vulnerabilities made at the “core”
						level. Further, your use of any payment method, including where
						permitted, any Cryptocurrency, is at your own risk and is subject
						to the terms and conditions and policies of such payment
						(service). You agree to hold GenZ Staking unaccountable for these
						types of risks, and to waive your right to litigate, arbitrate,
						mediate, or otherwise hold any type of claim against GenZ Staking
						for injuries suffered due to your use of a Blockchain network or
						service.</div>
