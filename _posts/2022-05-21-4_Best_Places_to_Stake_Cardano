Hot on the heels of Ethereum, Cardano is often dubbed an "Ethereum-killer." After fully implementing smart 
contracts and with its fast transaction times and low transaction fees, Cardano is an immensely popular 
alternative to Ethereum.

But the big question is, can you stake Cardano to earn passive income? And if so, what are the best places 
to stake ADA?

## Ethereum vs. Cardano: What's Best for Staking?

Looking at the market share of blockchain platforms with smart contract capability, we immediately see 
that Ethereum is way ahead of the game. As of June 12, 2022, it holds around $65 billion worth of crypto 
assets locked inside its smart contracts. Even though this figure is down on its high of $158 billion, 
the chart below illustrates just how Ethereum dominates the market.

To briefly recap the importance of smart contracts, they are a revolutionary financial innovation because 
they replicate all the banking services—borrowing, lending, exchange—without governments and banks being 
involved. So it is no wonder that within a short period, since the summer of 2020, decentralized finance 
(DeFi) had at one point amassed over $220 billion worth of crypto assets across all smart contract 
blockchains. At the time of writing, that figure has fallen to around $100 billion, but the long-range 
forecasts for DeFi predict a bright future.

The question then is, where is Cardano in this highly profitable picture? Should you stake ADA instead of 
ETH?

It's an interesting question when you look closely at each cryptocurrency and its blockchain. Ethereum and 
Cardano have followed different development paths but are closer than most people realize, with more unity 
set to come.

In short, Ethereum currently uses the proof of work consensus algorithm, similar to Bitcoin, in that it 
requires a huge amount of power to keep the network running, secure, and processing transactions. However, 
this is due to change with the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 upgrade that will switch Ethereum from proof of 
work to a proof of stake consensus.

Cardano was, in one sense, a step ahead of Ethereum. It already uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm, 
helping to keep transaction fees cheap and fast—perfect for smart contracts and ADA staking.

In the words of Cardano's creator, Charles Hoskinson:

    We need governance, we need certification, we need insurance, we need regulation on these things, 
    metadata identity… at the same time, you need to decentralize. The way we constructed Cardano 
    was for that second wave.

## How Does Cardano Staking Work?

When it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi), staking is the key term to understand. In traditional 
finance, if you were to deposit your money into a bank, you would technically stake those funds. The 
bank would use your money to issue loans and make other investments. In turn, you would receive a small 
interest rate percentage for placing your trust in the bank.

Staking in blockchain finance follows the same principle but is more direct and yields much higher 
rewards. Specifically, by staking ADA tokens, you become a part of the Cardano blockchain network. Your 
tokens are used for validating new blocks (transactions) on the network, contributing to its governance 
and security.

After all, this is the core feature of blockchain finance—decentralization. And the key tool to make it 
happen is the use of tokens. While a PoW blockchain like Bitcoin uses the term "mining," this is called 
staking in a PoS blockchain like Cardano. In return for your service of securing Cardano by staking ADA 
tokens, you receive a staking reward.

## Where to Stake Cardano (ADA)? The X Best Sites for ADA Staking

Here are the platforms where you can stake Cardano (ADA) and start this form of passive income.

1. Daedalus
2. Yoroi
3. Binance
4. Exodus

## Daedalus wallet

Deadalus is the official desktop crypto wallet developed by the Cardano team itself. By downloading 
and installing the Daedalus wallet, you will gain access to the entire copy of the Cardano 
blockchain. In technical terms, it is a full node wallet.

This means that you can even run your own Cardano node. When you stake your ADA coins in the Daedalus 
staking pool, you give the network your voting power. But do not worry, as you will still have full 
control over your ADA coins. The staking reward is 5 percent annually, 83 times higher than the 
national average interest rate for savings accounts at 0.05 percent.

Because it is a full node wallet, Daedalus requires a lot of storage space, which is required for 
Cardano's entire blockchain history of all transactions, past and future. However, as an official wallet 
of IOHK (Cardano's developers), this is the most secure and advanced option to stake your ADA 
cryptocurrency.


## Yoroi Wallet

Yoroi wallet is a step-down from Daedalus in terms of storage footprint. As a lightweight wallet, 
it is a more intuitive wallet to stake ADA tokens. Its lightness and user-friendliness extend so much 
that you can even download the Yoroi browser extension for all major platforms.

To simplify your potential staking rewards, you can filter staking pools by RoI (Return on Investment), 
staking cost, and pool size. The staking reward is similar to Daedalus, at around 5 percent APY 
(annual percentage yield).

## Binance locked staking

Binance is the world's largest exchange, which also serves as a web wallet. You can access it with 
any device capable of connecting to the internet. However, the price for that convenience is a custodial 
wallet, meaning Binance holds your private key, effectively controlling your funds instead of you.

Nonetheless, Binance offers the highest staking reward. If you lock your ADA tokens for at least 30 
days, you receive 5.09 percent APY.

You can also choose the lock-in periods of 60 or 90 days. Alternatively, the flexible option allows 
you to withdraw ADA coins at any time, but then your staking reward would only be up to 0.5 percent. 
Thankfully, the price of entry is just 1 ADA!


Another great option for ADA staking is the Exodus desktop wallet. You can use Exodus to stake ADA 
and receive up to a 4.91 percent stake reward, giving you a decent passive return on your investment.
One thing to note is that with Exodus, you need a minimum of 5 ADA to stake, and there is a first-time 
staking fee of 2 ADA plus the network fee. Exodus displays the full amount, but it's not expensive.

## Staking Cardano Delivers ADA Rewards

As people seek alternatives to Ethereum due to its high ETH gas fees, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, 
and Polkadot benefit. However, Cardano has long been the most comprehensively developed PoS blockchain 
with hack-resistant smart contracts.

So, it is just the right time to begin staking ADA ahead of Cardano's further network upgrades. And 
while ADA staking doesn't come with the highest returns, Cardano's stake rewards offer a very reasonable 
return.
