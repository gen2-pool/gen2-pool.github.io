				<p>GenZ Staking is a node staking mining pool on CSC(CoinEx Smart Chain), Etherume, Polkadot and many others, which
					allows users to vote and stake the
					nodes directly through MetaMask and many other wallets without professional knowledge.</p>

				<p>Common chains introduc the PoS mechanism. Nodes
					staking tokens, and then you can get corresponding mining and gas fee rewards. But this process needs to be
					done on the command line. The staking to obtain income is the just need of users. So we decided to make
					GenZ Staking Dashboard the staking mine pools. Through it, you can staking directly in your wallet to obtain
					income. We have also
					obtained the official support plan of coins.</p>
