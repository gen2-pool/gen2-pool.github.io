        <p>The power of blockchain technology for transforming technical infrastructures and systems worldwide has
          become clearly evident in recent times. However, the environmental impact of blockchain networks caused some
          controversy regarding the energy efficiency of Proof of Work or PoW-based blockchains. Therefore, Proof of
          Stake or PoS blockchains emerged as a viable solution. What is a delegated proof of stake for blockchain
          networks?Â </p>

        <p>With a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm already in place, it is reasonable to wonder about the necessity of
          DPoS consensus mechanism. The delegated PoS consensus protocol comes with the advantage of helping users spend
          coins for different delegates. After selection, the delegates can implement critical decisions for the whole
          network. The following discussion offers you an introductory guide on delegated proof of stake algorithm and
          how it works.</p>

        <p>Some time staking wiht coins are so hard and you have to use CLI commands. With <a href="/dashboard">GenZ 
          Staking Dashboard you</a> can stake as easy as connecting your MetaMaks to a web site.</p>
